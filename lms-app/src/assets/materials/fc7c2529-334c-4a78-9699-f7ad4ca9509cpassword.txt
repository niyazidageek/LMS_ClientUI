Task 5.1
Worldwide, enrollments in higher education are increasing, for instance, in developed
countries over half of all young people enter college, in addition to that, similar trends are seen in China and South Africa. This growth has put financial strain on state
university systems, hence, many countries are asking students and parents to contribute, and, as a result, this leads to a debate about whether students or society benefit from tertiary
education.

Task 5.2
China is one developing country (but not the only one) which has
imposed fees on students since 1997. But but the results have been
surprising: enrollments, especially in the most expensive universities, have
continued to rise steeply, growing 200 per cent overall between 1997 and 2001. It
seems in this case that higher fees attract rather than discourage students. Students
see them as a sign of a good education, and compete more fiercely for places. This leads to the result that a place at a good college can cost $5000 per year for
fees and maintenance.
